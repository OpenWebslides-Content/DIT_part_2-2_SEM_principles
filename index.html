		<p data-view-type="course">Secondary electron detectors are common in all SEMs, but it is rare that a single machine would have detectors for all
			possible signals. Secondary electrons are produced when an incident electron excites an electron in the sample and loses
			some of its energy in the process. The excited electron moves towards the surface of the sample undergoing elastic and
			inelastic collisions until it reaches the surface. Here it can escape if its energy exceeds the surface work function,
			Ew, which defines the amount of energy needed to remove electrons from the surface of a material. One of the major reasons
			for coating a non-conductive specimen with conductive materials is to increase the number of secondary electrons that
			will be emitted from the sample (decrease Ew).</p>

		<p data-view-type="course">The mean free path length of secondary electrons in many materials is ~1 nm (10 Å). Thus, although electrons are generated
			throughout the region excited by the incident beam, only those electrons that originate less than 1 nm deep in the sample
			escape to be detected as secondary electrons. This volume of production is very small compared with BSE and X-rays. Therefore,
			the resolution using SE is better than either of these and is effectively the same as the electron beam size. The shallow
			depth of production of detected secondary electrons makes them very sensitive to topography (Fig. 41b). </p>

			electrons, a small bias (usually around +200 to 300V) is applied to the cage at the front end of the detector to attract
			the negative electrons towards the detector (Fig. 44). A higher kV (e.g. 7 to 12kV) is applied inside the cage i.e. to
			the scintillator, to accelerate the electrons into the scintillator screen.</p>

		<p data-view-type="course">Most of the electron microscope systems have built-in several detector systems. Common signal detectors include backscattered
			electrons and detectors for characteristic X-rays, such as energy-dispersive (EDS also referred as EDX) or wavelength-dispersive
			(WDS). In case of EDS, the excited photons are collected as a function of their energy and the spectrum of energy-dependent,
			photon intensity is analysed to measure the chemical composition of the material (Brandon and Kaplan, 2008). In WDS, the
			intensity of the excited photons is collected as a function of their wavelength. EDS collectors collect the excited X-rays
			simultaneously over a wide range of energy and are therefore highly efficient (Brandon and Kaplan, 2008). A disadvantage
			of EDS is that it has a restricted energy resolution that may sometimes result in overlap of peaks in the X-ray signal.
			It is possible to obtain several EDS mappings: the electron beam is traversed across a selected region of the sample and
			the signal is recorded in each step. The spatial resolution of the EDS mappings depends on the pre-set steps per unit
			length of line. The detection limit will depend on the time of signal acquisition at each step. </p>

		<h1>Wavelength-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (WDS)</h1>
		<p>A wavelength-dispersive spectrometer uses the characteristic X-rays generated by individual elements to enable quantitative
			analyses (down to trace element levels) to be measured at spot sizes as small as a few micrometers.</p>
		<p>WDS can create element X-ray compositional maps over a broader area by means of rastering the beam.</p>
		<p>WDS provides fundamental quantitative compositional information for a wide variety of solid materials.</p>

		<h1>Wavelength-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (WDS)</h1>
		<p>WDS is complementary to energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS): WDS spectrometers have significantly higher spectral resolution
			and enhanced quantitative potential.</p>
		<p>Many SEM and EPMA (= electron probe micro-analyzer) instruments have EDS systems mounted to the column, and an EPMA typically
			has an array of several WDS spectrometers for simultaneous measurement of multiple elements.</p>
		<p>In typical EPMA applications, EDS is used for quick elemental scans to find out what a material contains, and WDS is then
			used to acquire precise chemical analyses of selected phases.</p>
